## Laravel Backend Test
Thanks for applying for our Frontend position here at Pinzak. We have prepared this rather simple test to have an idea of your current ability and see how you choose to structure code.

### Objective
The objective of this test is to build an API that does simple CRUD operations.

### Tasks
1. Create endpoint /news with the 4 basic operations: Create, Read, Update and Delete.
2. News should have the following attributes: id (int), title (string), author_id (int), article (string), is_published (bool)
3. The endpoint that returns the articles should accept pagination, basic filters and sorting.

### Suggestions
1. Feel free to use 3rd party packages if you feel it needs it.
2. Make sure you include all necessary files/settings to setup test environment. (migration files, configs, etc)
3. Do what you understand a "RESTful" API to be.
4. Make sure validation works on both creation and update.

## Others
Once you are done, push it to your own repository and share the link in the mail provided with this challenge.
